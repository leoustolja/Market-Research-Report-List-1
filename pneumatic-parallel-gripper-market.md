<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Parallel Gripper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting</li><li>Double Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pneumatic parallel gripper market is primarily divided into two types: single acting and double acting. Single acting grippers use air pressure to close the grip and rely on springs to return to the open position, making them simpler and less costly. In contrast, double acting grippers utilize air pressure for both closing and opening, offering greater control and precision in operations. This results in enhanced performance for complex tasks, making double acting grippers more suitable for intricate applications.</p></p>
