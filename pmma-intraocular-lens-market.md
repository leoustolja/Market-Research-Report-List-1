<p><p>PMMA (Polymethyl methacrylate) Intraocular Lenses are a type of artificial lens implanted in the eye, primarily used to replace the natural lens during cataract surgery. Known for their optical clarity and stability, PMMA lenses are rigid and non-flexible, which makes them suitable for specific surgical techniques. The use of PMMA lenses has been a standard practice in ophthalmology, and their longevity and effectiveness in visual correction contribute to their continued relevance.</p><p>The PMMA Intraocular Lens Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.7% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by an increasing prevalence of cataract and other vision-related disorders, a growing elderly population, and advancements in lens technologies. Furthermore, with rising healthcare expenditure and improved surgical techniques, more patients are opting for cataract surgeries, thereby boosting the demand for intraocular lenses. Emerging trends include the development of multifocal and accommodating lenses, which aim to enhance patient outcomes by providing a broader range of vision. Additionally, the rise of minimally invasive surgical procedures is influencing the market dynamics, promoting the adoption of various lens types and improving their accessibility to patients. Overall, the market is poised for significant expansion in the coming years.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PMMA Intraocular Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic</li><li>Hydrophobic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PMMA Intraocular Lens (IOL) market is segmented into hydrophilic and hydrophobic types based on their material properties. Hydrophilic IOLs are made from water-absorbing polymers, making them flexible and easier to implant. They provide excellent clarity and comfort but can absorb moisture, potentially affecting their performance. Hydrophobic IOLs, on the other hand, resist wetting and maintain their shape better during implantation, offering high stability and durability. Both types cater to varying patient needs in cataract surgery and vision correction.</p></p>
