<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tunable Diode Laser (TDL) Gas Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-Situ</li><li>Extractive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tunable Diode Laser (TDL) gas analyzers come in two primary market types: in-situ and extractive. In-situ analyzers measure gas concentration directly where the gas is present, providing real-time data with minimal interference. This method is often used in challenging environments. In contrast, extractive analyzers sample gas from a location, transporting it to the analyzer for measurement. This approach can offer more detailed analysis but may introduce delays and potential contamination. Both types are essential for accurate gas monitoring in various industries.</p></p>
