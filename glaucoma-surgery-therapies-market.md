<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glaucoma Surgery Therapies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laser Treatment</li><li>Incision Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glaucoma surgery therapies encompass two primary market types: laser treatment and incision surgery. Laser treatments, such as Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) and Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty (ALT), aim to improve fluid drainage and lower intraocular pressure with minimal recovery time. In contrast, incision surgeries, like Trabeculectomy and tube shunt implantation, involve creating a new drainage pathway for aqueous humor, often requiring longer recovery and more intensive post-operative care. Both approaches aim to enhance vision and prevent further damage related to glaucoma.</p></p>
