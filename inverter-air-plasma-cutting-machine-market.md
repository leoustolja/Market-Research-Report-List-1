<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inverter Air Plasma Cutting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Arc Ignition</li><li>Non-Contact Arc Ignition</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inverter Air Plasma Cutting Machines are categorized into two main types based on ignition methods: Contact Arc Ignition and Non-Contact Arc Ignition. Contact Arc Ignition initiates the arc by bringing the electrode into contact with the workpiece, ensuring a quick start but requiring direct contact. Conversely, Non-Contact Arc Ignition, also known as pilot arc ignition, creates an arc with a secondary electrode without touching the metal, allowing for easier starts and more precise cutting, particularly on painted or rusty surfaces.</p></p>
